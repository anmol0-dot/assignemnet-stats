🌞 Sunspot Time Series Analysis
🧭 Objective
The aim of this practical is to analyze monthly mean total sunspot numbers using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, and to model the phenomenon using a Gamma distribution.
The task includes time series visualization, distribution modeling, MCMC-based parameter estimation, and prediction of the Gamma parameters over different sample groups.

📊 Dataset Description
A sunspot is a region on the Sun’s surface (photosphere) with a lower temperature than its surroundings, caused by strong magnetic field concentrations that inhibit convection.
Sunspots:

Often appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity
Vary in number according to an approximate 11-year solar cycle
The dataset used here is the “Monthly mean total sunspot number”:

Property	Description
Source	World Data Center for the production, preservation and dissemination of the international sunspot number
Time Range	January 1749 to November 2018
Frequency	Monthly observations
Variable	Monthly mean total sunspot number
🧩 Note: This is a real-world scientific dataset widely used for solar activity and time series analysis.

🧪 Tasks Performed
🔹 Step 1 – Time Series Plot
Plot the sunspot numbers over time (months/years)
Visually inspect:
Overall trend
Periodicity / cycles (~11 years)
Variations in amplitude over time
🔹 Step 2 – Gamma Distribution Modeling (Per Cycle)
Model the sunspot counts using a Gamma distribution
Assume a new cycle resets every 12 years
For each 12-year cycle:
Fit a Gamma distribution with parameters a (shape) and b (rate/scale, depending on convention)
Compare how the parameters vary across cycles
🔹 Step 3 – Histogram of Sunspot Counts
Plot a histogram of the sunspot counts
Compare the empirical distribution with the Gamma model
Check whether the Gamma distribution is a reasonable fit for the data
🔹 Step 4 – MNMC with Different Sample Groups
Given fixed parameters a = 4 and b = 10, compute and plot the MNMC (Monte Carlo-based quantity/estimate) for:

First 50 samples
All samples
Last 50 samples
This allows comparison of how estimates behave on early, full, and recent data segments.

🔹 Step 5 – MCMC Traces for a and b
Use MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to estimate the posterior distributions of a and b
Perform:
Burn-in / burn-out: discard initial part of the chain to remove dependence on starting values
Plot:
Trace plots of a and b across iterations
Histograms of the sampled values for a and b
Check:
Convergence of the chains
Stability of the estimates
🔹 Step 6 – Prediction of a and b
Use the posterior samples of a and b to:
Compute point estimates (mean/median)
Provide interval estimates (credible intervals)
Interpret these as the predicted Gamma parameters for the sunspot process:
How concentrated is the distribution?
How heavy is the tail?
What does that imply about extreme sunspot activity?

🧾 Conclusion
The sunspot dataset represents a long-term monthly time series capturing solar activity cycles.

Key takeaways:

Time series plots clearly show cyclical behavior consistent with the known ~11-year solar cycle.
A Gamma distribution provides a useful model for non-negative, skewed sunspot counts.
Histograms and fitted Gamma curves help assess how well the model matches the empirical data.
MCMC-based inference yields posterior estimates of the Gamma parameters a and b, along with uncertainty.
Comparing MNMC estimates across first 50, all, and last 50 samples highlights how sample size and time period affect parameter estimates.
Trace plots and histograms of a and b confirm convergence and support reliable prediction of distribution parameters.
Overall, this practical demonstrates how probabilistic modeling + MCMC can be applied to a real-world scientific time series, providing both descriptive and predictive insight into solar activity patterns.
