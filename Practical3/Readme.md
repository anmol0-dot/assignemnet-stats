🎓 Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis – Practical 3 🧭 Objective This practical continues the analysis of the Teachers Rating Dataset (used in Practical 2). The goal is to perform data filtering, duplication checks, and visualization to explore relationships between instructors’ age, division, gender, and evaluation scores.

📊 Dataset Description The dataset contains information about university instructors and their teaching evaluations.

Column Description Prof Professor name (duplicates may appear for multiple courses) Gender Male or Female Tenure Indicates whether the professor is tenured (Yes or No) Beauty Instructor’s attractiveness score (contains outliers) Rating Teaching evaluation score (1–5 scale) Students Number of students in the class (includes one outlier with 300 students) Age Instructor’s age Division Course type: “Lower” or “Upper” Division ⚙ Tools Used Python 3.x

NumPy

pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🧾 Conclusion Duplicates exist due to multiple courses taught by the same instructor.

Mean age changes slightly when considering unique professors only.

Lower-division instructors may receive slightly higher evaluation scores.

No strong linear relationship is observed between age and ratings.

Visualization by gender and tenure highlights small variations, but no major bias is apparent.
